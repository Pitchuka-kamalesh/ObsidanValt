tab: sendKeys Method
Basic we are selenium method sendKeys to send path of the file to the webpage.
```java
public class Testers {  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AWTException, InterruptedException {  
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  
        driver.get("https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/");  
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));  
        Wait<WebDriver> wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(20));  
  
        final WebElement  login_username_input = driver.findElement(By.name("username"));  
  
        final WebElement login_password_input = driver.findElement(By.name("password"));  
  
        final WebElement login_submit_button = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[@type ='submit']"));  
  
  
        login_username_input.sendKeys("Admin");  
        login_password_input.sendKeys("admin123");  
        login_submit_button.click();  
  
        final WebElement Navgaction_PIM = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[text() = 'PIM']"));  
        Navgaction_PIM.click();  
  
        final WebElement Add_button = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[normalize-space()='Add']"));  
        Add_button.click();  
  
        final WebElement loader = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@class='oxd-form-loader']"));  
  
        if(loader.isDisplayed()){  
            System.out.println("loader is present");  
            System.out.println(wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOf(loader)));  
            if (wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOf(loader))){ 
             driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@type='file']")).sendKeys("Filepath"); 
            }  
        }  
  
```
> [!IMPORTANT] here we have find the input tage for the file upload and take action and send keys with the particular file location which you want to send don't click any add button to upload because it will popup windows or linux Explorer to upload file.

tab: Robot Class 
In the robot class we are using inbuild method for performing the keyboard actions and systemclipboard to perform the actions. all the method and class  are avalible in `import java.awt.*` package.
```java
  
Robot robot = new Robot();  
  
StringSelection str = new StringSelection("C:\\Users\\kamal\\Downloads\\issue.jpg");  
Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard().setContents(str,null);  
Thread.sleep(2000);  
  
robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);  
robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);  
  
robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL);  
robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_V);  
  
  
robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);  
robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER);

```
> [!IMPORTANT] here we will use ROBOT class and perform the action the windows or linux or mac Explorer here we are using the keyboard and mouse action to copy the file path  and copy it into system clipboard and then use use robot class to copy paste it. 

tab: AutoIt
