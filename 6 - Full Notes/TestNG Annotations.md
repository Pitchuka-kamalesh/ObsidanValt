| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| BeforeSuite  | The annotated method will be run before all tests in this suite have run.                                                                                                                | `@BeforeSuite`  |
| BeforeTest   | The annotated method will be run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run.                                                                           | `@BeforeTest`   |
| BeforeGroups | The list of groups that this configuration method will run before. This method is guaranteed to run shortly before the first test method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked. | `@BeforeGroups` |
| BeforeClass  | The annotated method will be run before the first test method in the current class is invoked.                                                                                           | `@BeforeClass`  |
| BeforeMethod | The annotated method will be run before each test method.                                                                                                                                | `@BeforeMethod` |

| AfterMethod  | The annotated method will be run after each test method.<br>                                                                                                                             | `@AfterMethod`  |
